    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>As a student at a new campus, I should not feel discouraged or inferior because of changes in the
        environment. Instead, this is an opportunity for me to develop and show my potential. Because the D4 program
        focuses more on practice than theory, I was directly involved in various activities that allowed me to
        demonstrate real skills and abilities. Instead of feeling like a small fish in a big pond, I prefer to be a
        big fish in a small pond, where I can have more influence and contribute significantly to my environment.
